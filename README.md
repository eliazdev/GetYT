GetYT is a GUI Front-End for yt-dlp, a youtube-dl fork. Created using Qt (PyQt) to make it cross-platform. Written in CPython.

  

## Features

  

* Playlist support

  

* Playlist creator on the fly

  

* MP3 Converter (From MP4)

* Cross-platform (GNU/Linux, Windows) (macOS, not tested)

  

Future Versions of GetYT will support even more video/sound formats.

## Building Instructions

First you have to clone the repository. Then you have the source code on your personal computer.

To start coding you need to install the program's dependencies. Of course you need Python 3 to run it. In addition, the program uses other libraries such as `yt-dlp` which manages the downloading stuff.


## Contributing

Basically, the license (Filename: LICENSE) informs you about that but I recommend you check the file todo. It includes ideas that should be done. If you came up with an idea and you think it will improve GetYT, feel free to share it. You can add it in the todo file.
